Uucd — Unicode character database decoder for OCaml
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release %%VERSION%%

Uucd is an OCaml module to decode the data of the [Unicode character 
database][1] from its XML [representation][2]. It provides high-level 
(but not necessarily efficient) access to the data so that efficient 
representations can be extracted.

Uucd is made of a single module, depends on [Xmlm][3] and is distributed
under the BSD3 license.

## Installation

Uucd can be installed with `opam`:

    opam install uucd

Otherwise to install Uucd you need at least :

If you have `findlib`, it can be installed by typing :

    ocaml setup.ml -configure
    ocaml setup.ml -build 
    ocaml setup.ml -install

If you don't, `uucd.mli` and `uucd.ml` contain everything, the
code, the documentation and the license. Install the dependencies and
use the sources the way you want.


## Documentation

The documentation and API reference is automatically generated by
`ocamldoc` from `uucd.mli`. It can be consulted [online][4] and there
is a generated version in the `doc` directory of the distribution.
